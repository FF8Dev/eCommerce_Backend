# eCommerce Backend 

This is the final project for my studies in CFGS DAM, focused on Multiplatform Software Development. This backend system is designed for a rental service of personal technological products such as cameras and tripods. It's capable of reading a database of products and selecting an initial and end date for rental. The program features dynamic discount functionality, including discounts for specific customers and discounts for multi-day rentals.
